Fiji is an image processing package based on ImageJ.

For users, Fiji is easy to install and update, bundles a set of plugins in a coherent menu structure (and updatable), along with comprehensive documentation.

For developers, Fiji as an open source project is hosted on a git source version control repository, with access to the source code of all internals, libraries and plugins, and eases the development and scripting of plugins.
